## About Me 🤓

Hey there, I'm [Amelia Citra](https://github.com/ameliacitradewi), but you can call me the *Code Magician*! 🎩✨ I'm a passionate developer who loves to blend humor into my code like sprinkles on a donut! 🍩 I believe laughter is the best debugging tool, and my mission is to spread joy through my repositories.

## Interests 🌟

- **Coding Wonders**: I'm obsessed with writing clean, efficient, and mind-boggling code. It's like solving puzzles, but way more fun! 🔍💡
- **Meme Engineering**: Transforming memes into working code is my guilty pleasure! 😂 I mean, why not merge humor and technology?
- **Tech Gadgets**: I'm a sucker for the latest gadgets. My desk looks like it's straight out of a sci-fi movie! 🛸📱

## My Projects 🚀

Here are some of the cool projects I've conjured up in my coding cauldron:

1. **WaterCalculator**: Behold, the brainchild of my iOS wizardry thanks to Angela Yu's Bootcamp—a water-calculation extravaganza that'll quench your thirst and make your water bottle feel like a rockstar on a world tour a.k.a The Hydrological Marvel! 💧🧙‍♂️🌊
2. **LovebirdsChatApp**: Where Chatting Feels Like Performing a Stand-up Comedy Act! 🎭🎙️
3. **FastingFit**: The App That Makes Fasting a Piece of Cake! 🍰⏰
4. **Python-Ecommerce-with-Django-Frameworks**: You can call me the Shopping Wizard! 🧙‍♂️✨ I've brewed up this enchanting e-commerce website, sprinkled with laughter and powered by Python and Django, to make your shopping escapades unforgettable!

## Fun Fact 🎉

Did you know that I once accidentally made my computer laugh? I left an infinite loop running, and it printed "Ha" repeatedly until my roommates thought there was a laughter party going on in my room! 😅 Lesson learned: laughter is contagious, even for machines! 😆
